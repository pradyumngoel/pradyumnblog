You see the image up there? that's me in a cartoon version wearing a mask! I made this self portrait by tracing the image of my face in a drawing app called Procreate.

I am a child programmer who loves to make and play games. My talents are in Javascript, HTML and CSS. I mostly do Hugo for fun. I also sometimes make drawings in Procreate

Here are the games I play:

Roblox (including bedwars and yba, occasionally other games)

Minecraft

And I play other type of games like moonlighter, dragon quest builder 2, torchlight 3 etc.
