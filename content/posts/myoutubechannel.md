Hello Everybody, So I'm here to show you my youtube channel that I've been maintaining for a few months now. It's called "The Mosquiteer".

In the latest videos, me and my friends have been doing funny videos and songs. In my opinion(and for the other people I showed this channel to) these videos are epic. So I am hoping to continue them.
