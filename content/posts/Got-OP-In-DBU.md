So I made a lot of progress in DBU(Dragonblox Ultimate) and got 1.2 million all stats all stats. I can typically 1-shot a lot of bosses now.

I have the SSJB form and have changed my avatar to Broly. It is a character from Dragon Ball Z

As you can see I am making tons of progress and I am so close to rebirthing. Which I will need to do in order to get fusion
