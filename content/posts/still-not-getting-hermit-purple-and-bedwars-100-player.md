Well I just tried getting hermit purple through rokas and arrows... again. Instead when all my rokas finished. I got airsmith. Which is like such a bad stand. I don't think this game will ever give me hermit purple. But I have to keep trying.

Also today I played Roblox Bedwars with my friends. There is this new gamemode (which was there earlier but got removed) called 100 player mode. It's like 24 teams, some colors are same, but the same colors are like some are aplha some are beta some are charlie.

So I just went to destroy beds at the start of the game and destroyed the most beds out of a 100 people. I was using bounty hunter kit. So I killed those users and got emeralds and pretty soon got all diamond tools and tons of balloons.

Well then all the teams got eradicated and only our team was left... Then I discovered that we had to kill our own teammates -\_-

Well then only some people were left to kill. But unfortunately I had to go that time and couldn't win the game.
