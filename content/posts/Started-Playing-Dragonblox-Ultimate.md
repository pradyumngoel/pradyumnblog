Well I got bored of YBA and wanted to play something else. Then I found this game called Dragonblox Ultimate. It's a very good game and is exactly the type of games which I find most fun. Grinding games.

It's like a simulator. With stats and everything. On the first day itself I got like 50,00 stats and SSJ2 Form. I am currently aiming for Majin SSJ. As my side is evil.

Well so I guess I left YBA but it's ok since I found an equally awsome game.
